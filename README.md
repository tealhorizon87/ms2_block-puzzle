## UX
This is a web-based game made with HTML and CSS, and animated and controlled using JavaScript. The game is inspired by the ever popular Tetris game and follows similar rules and gameplay.

### User Stories
### Design

The game is contained on a single web-page. The layout of the page is clean and efficient, with controls and other content such as the rules, current score and level displayed alongside. In order to maintain a clean design, some of these additional items are contained in overlays, accessed through controls on the main page.
