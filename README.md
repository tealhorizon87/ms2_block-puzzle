## UX
This is a web-based game made with HTML and CSS, and animated and controlled using JavaScript. The game is inspired by the ever popular Tetris game and follows some principles of the original.

### User Stories
### Design

The game is contained on a single web-page. There is a navigation bar of sorts allowing users to select pop-out modals for 'rules' and 'contact' where the user will find information on how to play the game, and how to contact the owner to suggest/request improvements or to report bugs respectively.
